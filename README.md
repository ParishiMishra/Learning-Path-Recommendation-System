# Personalized Learning Path Recommendations Using Student Performance and Behavioral Data
<br>
<p>The objective of this project is develop a personalized learning path recommendation system that dynamically adapts to real-time changes in student performance and behavior using deep reinforcement learning and multi-modal data fusion techniques.</p>
<br>
<p>It does real time data integration and gives a predictive
analysis to forecast future performance and potential difficulties. This will help in preemptively adjusting the learning path to mitigate challenges and optimize learning outcomes.</p>
